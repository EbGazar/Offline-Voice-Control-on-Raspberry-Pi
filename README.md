# Offline Voice Control on Raspberry Pi.

Designed To Run On:

* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
* [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The Voice Control Consists of:

* Speech-to-Text engine is a piece of software that interprets human voice into a string of text. It lets the computer know what is being said.
* Text-to-Speech engine converts text into sound. It allows the computer to speak, probably as a response to your command.

The Voice Control uses:

* [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) as the Speech-to-Text engine.
* [PYTTSX3](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the Text-to-Speech engine.

For Order to use the Voice Control System you will need to:

1 - Speakers Plugged into the Raspberry Pi usingn Jack.
2 - Microphone Plugged ( Wired (USB) or Bluetooth ).
